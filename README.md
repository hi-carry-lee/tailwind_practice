# TailwindCSS Practice Collection

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of TailwindCSS projects, reimagined and implemented using Next.js. While working as a full-stack developer, I recognized the need to enhance my CSS skills, particularly in modern styling approaches.

The projects are inspired by Brad Traversy's excellent TailwindCSS course on Udemy. Although the original course uses vanilla JavaScript, I've taken the initiative to rebuild these projects using Next.js, aligning them with my current focus on Next.js development.

This collection represents both a learning journey and a practical implementation of advanced CSS concepts through TailwindCSS in a modern React framework.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
