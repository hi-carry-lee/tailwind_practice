# Why this project?

As a full-stack developer with 4 years of experience, you'd think I'd be pretty comfortable with CSS. But when I started working on my own projects, I realized CSS was actually my biggest stumbling block. Sure, some might suggest using AI to write CSS for me, but I understand one simple truth: I can't effectively use AI for something I don't understand myself.

That's why I invested in two CSS courses on Udemy. Since I also wanted to improve my NextJS skills and get familiar with popular CSS tools, I created this project. Here, I'm rebuilding every case study using TailwindCSS and NextJS (though honestly, most cases don't really need JS - I'm using NextJS mainly to make it easier to add new features in the future).

Through these small CSS projects, I aim to build a more comprehensive understanding of CSS. These projects will not only serve as inspiration for my future CSS work but also act as a practical reference guide when I'm working on professional projects.
